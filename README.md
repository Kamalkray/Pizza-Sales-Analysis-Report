                                             **Project Title: Pizza Sales Analysis Report**

**Project Overview:**
The Pizza Sales Analysis Report project involved the extraction, transformation, and visualization of pizza sales data obtained from Kaggle using Power BI. The objective was to gain insights into sales performance, identify best and worst sellers, and provide a user-friendly dashboard for effective decision-making.

**Data Extraction:**
Source Selection (Kaggle): The project aimed to tap into the wealth of data available on Kaggle, a prominent platform for diverse datasets. This ensured access to a relevant and extensive dataset related to pizza sales, laying the foundation for comprehensive analysis.
Data Transformation:
ETL Processes (Power Query): The project recognized the importance of data quality in meaningful analysis. Utilizing Power Query, the team engaged in Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) activities. This involved restructuring and standardizing the data, such as converting size abbreviations to more readable formats (M, L, S to Medium, Large, Small).

**Dashboard Visualization:**
Power BI Utilization: The core of the project's objective was to leverage Power BI's robust visualization capabilities. The team aimed to create an interactive and visually appealing dashboard that could effectively communicate insights derived from the data.

**Stakeholder Engagement:**
Comprehensive Insights: The ultimate goal was to cater to the needs of stakeholders involved in the pizza sales business. The project sought to provide a holistic view of sales performance, allowing stakeholders to make informed decisions. This encompassed not only revenue-related metrics but also nuanced insights like average order value, pizza category preferences, and size distribution.

**Identification of Best and Worst Sellers:**
Sales Performance Evaluation: The project aimed to go beyond basic metrics by identifying the top-performing and bottom-performing products. This involved analyzing revenue, quantity sold, and order frequency to pinpoint the best and worst sellers in the product portfolio.

**Interactive Dashboard:**
User-Friendly Interface: Recognizing the importance of accessibility, the project strived to create an interactive dashboard. This would allow stakeholders to explore data dynamically, filter results based on specific criteria (e.g., date and category), and seamlessly navigate between different sections of the report.

**Facilitating Data-Driven Decision-Making:**
Empowering Stakeholders: The broader objective was to empower stakeholders with actionable insights. By visualizing patterns, trends, and key performance indicators, the project sought to facilitate data-driven decision-making. This, in turn, would contribute to more informed strategies and operational adjustments within the pizza sales business.
In essence, the primary objective of the Pizza Sales Analysis Report project was not merely to generate a static report but to dynamically present insights that empower stakeholders, foster informed decision-making, and enhance the overall efficiency and competitiveness of the pizza sales business.

**Dashboard Design:**
The project's central feature was a two-page dashboard:
